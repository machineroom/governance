# Main Governance Document

The official version of this document, along with a list of
individuals in the roles defined in the governance
section below, is contained in The Project Governance Repository at:

[https://github.com/opendatacube/governance](https://github.com/opendatacube/governance)

## The Project

The **Open Data Cube** (The Project) is an open source software project. The goal of The Project is to develop open source software and deploy open and public websites and services that provide a new approach for organising and analysing the vast quantities of satellite imagery and other Earth observation data, making it quicker and easier to use in diverse fields ranging across environment, water quality, hazards and agriculture. The Software developed
by The Project is released under the **Apache 2** (or similar) open source license,
developed openly and hosted in public GitHub repositories under the
[Open Data Cube GitHub organization](https://github.com/opendatacube). Examples of
Project Software include the Data Cube Core, the CEOS UI, other algorithms, and user interfaces, etc.
The Services run by the Project consist of public websites and web-services that are hosted
under the opendatacube.org domain. An example of
a Project Service includes the Open Data Cube website
([http://opendatacube.org](http://opendatacube.org)).

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called
**Contributors**. Contributors are individuals who have contributed code,
documentation, designs or other work to one or more Project repositories.
Anyone can be a Contributor. Contributors can be affiliated with any legal
entity or none. Contributors participate in the project by submitting,
reviewing and discussing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues and participating in
open and public Project discussions on GitHub, Slack, Google Groups, and mailing lists. The foundation of Project participation is openness and transparency.

There are also many other Contributors listed in the logs of other repositories of
the Open Data Cube project.

The **Project Community** consists of all Contributors and Users of the Project.
Contributors work on behalf of and are responsible to the larger Project
Community and we strive to keep the barrier between Contributors and Users as
low as possible.

## Governance

This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project.

The foundations of Project governance are:

- Openness & Transparency
- Active Contribution
- Institutional Neutrality

The Project leadership will consist a Steering Council, made up of a group of ongoing
active contributors.

## Chair of Steering Council

The Project will have a Chair of the Steering Council. The Chair has the authority to make all final decisions for The Project. In practice the Chair chooses to defer that authority to the consensus of the community discussion channels and the Steering Council (see below). It is expected that the Chair will only rarely assert his/her final authority. Because rarely used, we refer to the Chair’s final authority as a “special” or “overriding” vote. When it does occur, the Chair override typically happens in situations where there is a deadlock in the Steering Council or if the Steering Council asks the Chair to make a decision on a specific matter. To ensure the integrity of The Project, The Project encourages others to fork the project if they disagree with the overall direction the Steering Council. The Chair may delegate his/her authority on a particular decision or set of decisions to any other Council member at his/her discretion.

The Chair will be selected from amongst the Steering Council membership and reside in that role for a period of twelve months in duration, at which time the position will rotate to another member of the Steering Council (where possible from an alternative organisation affiliation).

Chairs are selected by self nomination, and if there is more than on nominee, then a vote is undertaken by all Steering Council members.

## Steering Council

The Project will have a **Steering Council** that consists of Project Contributors
who have produced contributions that are substantial in quality and quantity,
and sustained over at least one year. The overall role of the Council is to
ensure the long-term well-being of the project, both technically and as a community.

During the everyday project activities, **Council Members** participate in all
discussions, code review and other project activities as peers with all other
Contributors and the Community. In these everyday activities, Council Members
do not have any special power or privilege through their membership on the
Council. However, it is expected that because of the quality and quantity of
their contributions and their expert knowledge of the Project Software and
Services that Council Members will provide useful guidance, both technical and
in terms of project direction, to potentially less experienced contributors.

The Steering Council and its Members play a special role in certain situations.
In particular, the Council may:

- Make decisions about the overall scope, vision and direction of the
    project.
- Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or
    individuals.
- Make decisions about specific technical issues, features, bugs and pull
    requests. They are the primary mechanism of guiding the code review process
    and merging pull requests.
- Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage
    those Services for the benefit of the Project and Community.
- Make decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce consensus
    on an issue in a reasonable time frame.

### Council membership

To become eligible for being a Steering Council Member an individual must be a
Project Contributor who has produced contributions that are substantial in
quality and quantity, and sustained over at least one year. Potential Council
Members are nominated by existing Council members and voted upon by the
existing Council after asking if the potential Member is interested and willing
to serve in that capacity. The Council will be initially formed from the set of
existing Core Developers who, as of early 2017, have been significantly active
over the last year.

When considering potential Members, the Council will look at candidates with a
comprehensive view of their contributions. This will include but is not limited
to code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat participation,
community help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We are
deliberately not setting arbitrary quantitative metrics (like “100 commits in
this repo”) to avoid encouraging behavior that plays to the metrics rather than
the project’s overall well-being. We want to encourage a diverse array of
backgrounds, viewpoints and talents in our team, which is why we explicitly do
not define code as the sole metric on which council membership will be
evaluated.

If a Council member becomes inactive in the project for a period of one year,
they will be considered for removal from the Council. Before removal, the inactive
Member will be approached by the Chair to see if they plan on returning to
active participation. If not they will be removed immediately upon a Council
vote. If they plan on returning to active participation soon, they will be
given a grace period of one year. If they don’t return to active participation
within that time period they will be removed by vote of the Council without
further grace period. All former Council members can be considered for
membership again at any time in the future, like any other Project Contributor.
 Retired Council members will be listed on the project website, acknowledging
the period during which they were active in the Council.

The Council reserves the right to eject current Members,
if they are deemed to be actively harmful to the project’s well-being, and
attempts at communication and conflict resolution have failed.

### Conflict of interest

It is expected that the Chair and Council Members will be employed at a wide
range of companies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this,
it is possible that Members will have conflict of interests. Such conflict of
interests include, but are not limited to:

- Financial interests, such as investments, employment or contracting work,
    outside of The Project that may influence their work on The Project.
- Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially
    leak into their work with The Project.

All members of the Council, Chair included, shall disclose to the rest of the
Council any conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of
interest in a particular issue may participate in Council discussions on that
issue, but must recuse themselves from voting on the issue. If the Chair has recused his/herself for a particular decision, they will appoint a substitute Chair for that decision.

### Private communications of the Council

Unless specifically required, all Council discussions and activities will be
public and done in collaboration and discussion with the Project Contributors
and Community. The Council will have a private mailing list that will be used
sparingly and only when a specific matter requires privacy. When private
communications and decisions are needed, the Council will do its best to
summarize those to the Community after eliding personal/private/sensitive
information that should not be posted to the public internet.

### Subcommittees

The Council can create subcommittees that provide leadership and guidance for
specific aspects of the project. Like the Council as a whole, subcommittees
should conduct their business in an open and public manner unless privacy is
specifically called for. Private subcommittee communications should happen on
the main private mailing list of the Council unless specifically called for.

### Working groups

Working groups may be formed from time-to-time to undertake a body of technical
work. Each body of work should be well defined and reasonably achievable over a 
short period of time, so that the working group can execute efficiently.

### Licenses

The Open Data Cube project, as the name suggests, adopts licenses that reflect
our open approach. This applies both to the code in this repository but, ideally,
also to data used within Open Data Cube deployments.

Code within the Open Data Cube repository will be available via the
[Apache License Version 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Open  Data Cube deployments should clearly identify the useage conditions under which
data can be used. The recommended open data licence is the Creative Commons Attribution
4.0 International license [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
Licenses for commercial data will be vary.

## Changing the Governance Documents

Changes to the governance documents are submitted via a GitHub pull
request to The Project's governance documents GitHub repository at
[https://github.com/opendatacube/governance](https://github.com/opendatacube/governance).
The pull request is then refined in response to public comment and
review, with the goal being consensus in the community.  After this
open period, a Steering Council Member proposes to the Steering
Council that the changes be ratified and the pull request merged
(accepting the proposed changes) or proposes that the pull request be
closed without merging (rejecting the proposed changes).  The Member
should state the final commit hash in the pull request being proposed
for acceptance or rejection and briefly summarize the pull request. A
minimum of 80% of the Steering Council must vote and at least 2/3 of
the votes must be positive to carry out the proposed action (fractions
of a vote rounded up to the nearest integer).
