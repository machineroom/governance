## Our copyright policy

Open Data Cube uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Open Data Cube. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Open Data Cube
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Open Data Cube
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Open Data Cube repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:
